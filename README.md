# BeeScooters
Project File for Android App

# Project Title

Bee Scooters is a proof of concept electronic scooter sharing application. With this application users can view scooters that are located nearby to them and get directions on how to reach it. Once they have reached the scooter, all they have to do is scan the QR code and begin riding. This application implements third party APIs such as Google Maps and Braintree. Google Maps is used to display scooter locations and provide navigation while Braintree provides the payment gateway for users to add credits to their account.
